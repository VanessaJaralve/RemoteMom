# RemoteMom Validation Collection Setup

The landing page validation survey now submits to `/api/validation`. The waitlist forms submit to
`/api/waitlist`. The separate beta tester feedback page submits to `/api/beta-feedback`.

Response sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-uWXiAuLlIsGZ5TZ6_SVR11Vwt7CNPbvOMbcmCNAr1s/edit

## Required Environment Variable

Set this variable on the hosting platform before sharing the landing page publicly:

```text
VALIDATION_SUBMISSIONS_WEBHOOK_URL=<your secure webhook URL>
```

The endpoints forward each completed validation survey, waitlist signup, or beta feedback response as
JSON to that webhook. Use `integrations/google-apps-script/validation-webhook.gs` as the first
webhook destination. Deploy it from the personal Gmail account that owns the response sheet.

## Google Apps Script Deployment

1. Open the response sheet above.
2. Go to Extensions > Apps Script.
3. Replace the default script with `integrations/google-apps-script/validation-webhook.gs`.
4. Deploy it as a web app.
5. Set access to anyone with the link.
6. Copy the web app URL into `VALIDATION_SUBMISSIONS_WEBHOOK_URL` on the hosting platform.

## Expected Payload

```json
{
  "childrenCount": "one",
  "hardestArea": "child",
  "premiumFeature": "reminders",
  "priceComfort": "39-year",
  "interviewPermission": "yes",
  "submittedAt": "2026-08-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Waitlist submissions are sent as:

```json
{
  "email": "vanessa@example.com",
  "name": "Vanessa",
  "submissionType": "waitlist",
  "submittedAt": "2026-08-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Beta feedback submissions are sent as:

```json
{
  "submissionType": "beta-feedback",
  "name": "Vanessa",
  "email": "vanessa@example.com",
  "installedAndOpened": "yes",
  "understoodPurpose": "yes",
  "firstScreen": "today",
  "todayHelped": "somewhat",
  "mostUsefulFeature": "The Today view helped me see what to do next.",
  "confusingOrTooMuch": "The medicine section needs clearer time controls.",
  "oneChildEnough": "yes-for-beta",
  "nextPriority": "sharing",
  "useAgainTomorrow": "yes",
  "worthPayingFor": "maybe",
  "bugsOrIssues": "No crash found.",
  "submittedAt": "2026-08-10T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Google Apps Script routes `submissionType: "beta-feedback"` responses into a `Beta Feedback` tab.
Tester feedback should not include private medicine names, dosage details, child details, or other
sensitive family information.

## Preview Behavior

If an endpoint is unavailable or the webhook is not configured, the landing page saves a local backup
in the visitor's browser under `remotemom:validation-survey`, `remotemom:waitlist`, or
`remotemom:beta-feedback`. That keeps local preview useful, but public collection requires the
webhook variable above.
